# Awesome Onchain Apps [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of awesome open-source onchain apps.

Every entry links to a genuinely public, open-source repository containing real app, frontend, protocol, or SDK code. Where a project's app is closed-source but its protocol code is open, the entry points at the open component and says so.
